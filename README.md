We are developing an app that will make it easy to view data collected by Parker Solar Probe.

Many NASA spacecraft, along with the most advanced PARKER Solar Probe, collect data about space weather and the Sun. The data collected by these spacecraft help us forecast major solar events as well as broaden our knowledge about space weather. However, for the broader audience the data can seem quite confusing and at times daunting. Hence, we have developed an interactive and creative tool that will help people understand space weather and its significance. Our application offers AR & VR view of NASA space crafts, Parker Solar Probe game, simple and modern user interface and many other features that makes the journey of learning space weather and its impacts fun for people of any age.
